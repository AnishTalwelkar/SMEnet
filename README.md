# SMEnet (Currently under development)

### Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the extraordinary situations that has impacted the stability and resilience of MSMEs leading to massive layoffs, and even closures. Small businesses are a vibrant source of innovation and competition, and an essential source of employment. MSMEs contribute a lot to a country’s GDP and considering the high number of layoffs happening in India and worldwide there is surely a need for a platform to address them. We have developed a platform that uses an NLP based recommender system to help connect the right SMEs together. It’s aim is to provide a place for small business owners who, unfortunately, have had to let go of their employees and want to give them new employment opportunities. There are small businesses in other sectors who have been doing well and are in need of new employees. Businesses in these two categories can sign up on the website and can connect with each other.

### Introduction
In today's world, time has more value and people would rather have a machine tell them what they like or want than searching for it themselves. Like many machine learning techniques, a recommender system makes predictions based on user history. Specifically, it’s used to predict user preference for a set of items based on some past experience. To build a recommender system, the most two popular approaches are Content-based and Collaborative Filtering.
Our website uses a user based recommender system which would give recommendations to the companies that are looking for help, guidance or collaborations with other companies. 
The recommender system proposed here uses three major factors - datasets, prediction based on past user applications and the results are then sorted by using cosine similarity.
